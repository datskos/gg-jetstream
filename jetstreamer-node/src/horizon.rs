//! Horizon archive recorder.
//!
//! Assembles the two data streams the node produces into per-slot horizon
//! archive frames and streams them to an
//! [`ArchiveWriter`](jetstreamer_horizon::archive::ArchiveWriter):
//!
//! - **Input side (firehose thread)**: the original chain's block metadata
//!   (rewards, blockhashes, block time/height) via
//!   [`record_block_meta`](HorizonRecorder::record_block_meta). Transactions
//!   and entries also originate here but travel through the
//!   `TransactionScheduler` so they reach the recorder on the replay thread
//!   in execution order, paired with their original `TransactionStatusMeta`.
//! - **Replay side (ready-entry thread)**: geyser account updates in true
//!   bank execution order via
//!   [`record_account_update`](HorizonRecorder::record_account_update)
//!   (transaction-owned when the store carried a `txn`, orphan otherwise),
//!   and committed entries with their transactions via
//!   [`record_committed_entry`](HorizonRecorder::record_committed_entry).
//!
//! # Slot lifecycle
//!
//! A slot's frame can only close once its bank froze (the freeze emits the
//! end-of-slot "post" orphan updates: fee distribution, incinerator, …),
//! and the bank for slot `S` freezes when the bank for the next replayed
//! slot is created. Both recorder entry points therefore double as the
//! advance signal: any activity tagged with slot `S` proves every earlier
//! slot is complete, so buffered assemblies `< S` are emitted. Stream
//! order also guarantees the input-side block metadata for those slots
//! arrived before any later slot's entries, so emission never has to wait.
//!
//! Frames are written in canonical wire order (epoch meta → pre-orphans →
//! transactions → post-orphans → block meta → entries); gap slots between
//! consecutive blocks are emitted as leader-skipped frames after checking
//! the slot-presence map (a gap that old-faithful says *should* have a
//! block means the archive would be silently incomplete — fatal).
//!
//! Integrity violations panic: the archive is the product of the run, and
//! the node's replay machinery already treats divergence as fatal.
