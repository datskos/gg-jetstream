//! Horizon-native plugin framework — the zero-copy counterpart to the
//! Old-Faithful [`Plugin`](crate::Plugin) system.
//!
//! Plugins here consume horizon's own record types directly (`&Transaction`,
//! `&BlockNotification`, `&EpochMeta`) with no conversion back to Solana
//! runtime types, so the whole `.jet` → ClickHouse path is zero-copy. Each
//! `.jet` is read in parallel by [`firehose_horizon`]; one
//! [`PluginWorker`] is spawned per reader thread and owns its own mutable
//! state, so the hot path is lock-free. Workers accumulate rows and `flush`
//! them to an [`Output`] that hands inserts to a background async writer —
//! the decode threads never block on ClickHouse I/O.
